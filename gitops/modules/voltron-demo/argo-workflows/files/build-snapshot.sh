# Builds a candidate persistent-disk snapshot for the voltron-demo workstation
# image.
#
# A workstation is created from the builder config and started once, which is
# what materialises and populates its regional persistent disk (the CARLA
# installation and the AAOS tree live on that disk, not in the container
# image). The workstation is then stopped so the disk is quiesced, snapshotted,
# and the workstation torn down again.
#
# Why gcloud and not Config Connector (KCC): the cluster runs the GKE
# Config Connector add-on at v1.126.0, which ships WorkstationCluster but
# neither WorkstationConfig nor Workstation, so there is no CRD to express any
# of this. Even where a CRD does exist (ComputeSnapshot), the source disk name
# is only discoverable at runtime and the create/start/stop/snapshot/delete
# sequence is one-shot and imperative, which a reconciling controller models
# poorly. See the module README for the full rationale.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   PROJECT          GCP project id
#   REGION           GCP region
#   CLUSTER          Cloud Workstations cluster name
#   CONFIG           Cloud Workstations *builder* config name
#   WORKFLOW_UID     Argo workflow UID, used to name per-run resources
#   CONTAINER_IMAGE  Freshly built workstation container image
#
# Output:
#   Writes the created snapshot name to /tmp/candidate_snapshot_name.
