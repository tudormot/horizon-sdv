# Acceptance tests for the voltron-demo workstation image and its persistent
# disk snapshot. These run ON a temporary Cloud Workstation booted from the
# candidate snapshot, before that snapshot is promoted to "latest".
#
# They deliberately exercise the workstation the way a developer would — via an
# interactive shell that sources ~/.bashrc — because the aliases and helper
# functions under test (launch_2vm, clear_2vm, ds_toolkit) are only defined
# there.
