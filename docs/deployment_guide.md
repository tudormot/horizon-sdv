## Technologies
Technologies being used to provision the infrastructure along with the required applications for the GKE cluster.
* Google Cloud Platform - cloud service provider facilitating infrastructure provisioning.
* Terraform             - IaC tool used to provision the infrastructure and maintain infrastructure consistency.
* Git repository        - source code management where infrastructure configuration, Kubernetes application manifests, and workload scripts are stored. GitHub is one supported option.
* Argo CD               - declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

## Project directories and files
The project is implemented in the following directories:

+ **gitops**    - Kubernetes application manifests for Argo CD, contains desired state of the cluster.
+ **terraform** - IaC configuration files to provision the infrastructure required for the GKE cluster.
+ **workloads** - Jenkins workflow scripts for the pipeline build jobs.
+ **tools**     - User management and automated deployment scripts.

### Section #1c - Create a Bucket in GCP
In the current GCP project, it is required to create a GCP Bucket to store data related to the infrastructure. Follow the below steps to create a Bucket.
1. On the GCP Console, navigate to Cloud Storage and click on Buckets.
2. Click on CREATE/CREATE BUCKET button.
3. Enter a globally unique name for the bucket. (Example: `my-cloud-project-abc-123-bucket`)
4. Click on CONTINUE with default options for other sections.
5. Click on CREATE.
6. If any pop-up window appears, click on CONFIRM.

<details>
<summary><code>gcloud</code> CLI</summary>
<pre>
<code>gcloud storage buckets create gs://&lt;GCP_BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME&gt;</code>
</details>

### Section #1d - Create OAuth2 Client and Secret

> [!NOTE]
> This section covers setting up Google as the identity provider for Keycloak SSO. It is the documented and tested authentication path.
>
> The platform does not enforce Google as the only option. Keycloak supports many identity providers including Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Okta, GitHub, SAML 2.0, LDAP, and any OIDC-compatible provider. Configuring a different provider is possible but not covered in this guide.
>
> Terraform does not require these credentials during deployment. The GCP Secret Manager entry for the OAuth2 client secret is initialized with a placeholder value by Terraform and must be updated manually after the cluster is running.
>
> If you already have a Google OAuth2 client, you can reuse it by adding the redirect URI: `https://<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>/auth/realms/horizon/broker/google/endpoint`
>
> Without completing this section, the platform deploys successfully and admin access via Keycloak username/password still works.

It is required to setup OAuth consent screen before creating the OAuth client and secret. Navigate to APIs & Services and follow the below mentioned steps

#### Setting up OAuth consent screen
Once in APIs & Services, click on OAuth consent screen to start the setup process.

1. Under Overview, click on GET STARTED.
2. Enter "Horizon - SDV" as the App name and select User support email of your choice.
3. Click on NEXT.
4. Under Audience, select External and click on NEXT.
5. Under Contact Information, provide an email address of your choice and click on NEXT.
6. Click on the checkbox under Finish and click on CONTINUE.
7. Click on CREATE.
8. Now, click on Branding. Scroll down and find App domain section.
9. Provide Application home page under App domain, example: `https://<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>`
10. Under Authorized domains, click on ADD DOMAIN and Provide Authorized domain 1 name, example: `<HORIZON_DOMAIN>`
11. Click on SAVE.   
   <img src="images/gcp_oauth_consent_screen.png" width="650" />   

#### Create OAuth client ID
1. Go to APIs & Services, click on Credentials.
2. Click on CREATE CREDENTIALS and select "OAuth client ID" from the list.
3. Select Application type as "Web application".
4. Provide Name as "Horizon".
5. Under Authorized redirect URIs enter the URI which points google endpoint of Keycloak.   
   Example: `https://<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>/auth/realms/horizon/broker/google/endpoint`.
6. Clicking on CREATE opens a pop-up window containing client ID and secret which can be copied and saved locally to a file or download the credential detail as a JSON file. Click on OK for the pop-up window to close.  
   > **Note:** Please ensure you save the client secret immediately. For security reasons, the secret will be hidden later and cannot be copied again.   
   <img src="images/gcp_oauth_client_details.png" width="325" />
7. The credential will appear Under OAuth 2.0 Client IDs as below and credential details can be viewed and edited by clicking on the Name of the OAuth 2.0 Client ID.   
   <img src="images/gcp_oauth_client_list.png" width="325" />

<details>
<summary><strong>Managing Client Secret (Rotation & Storage)</strong></summary>

<br>

**If you lose the secret or need to rotate it:**
1. Naviagte to **APIs & Services** and click on **Credentials**.
2. Click on the name of your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Horizon - SDV) in the Credentials list.
3. Click the **Add secret** button.
4. Copy the new **Client secret** and save it for future use.
5. Click on **Disable** and **Delete** (Bin icon) the old Client secret.
6. Click **Save**.
7. This will immediately revoke the old client secret and generate a new one.

**Store in GCP Secret Manager:**
1.  Navigate to **Security** > **Secret Manager** in the GCP Console.
2.  Click **CREATE SECRET**.
3.  Name the secret (e.g., `oauth2-client-secret`).
4.  In the **Secret value** field, paste the Client Secret you copied earlier.
5.  Click **Create secret**.
   
> **Important:** If you reset the OAuth Client secret manually in the future, you must manually add a new version to this Secret in Secret Manager with the new value. Terraform will not automatically update this value as the secret is generated outside of Terraform.

</details>

## Section #2 - Deployment
This section covers the steps to deploy the Horizon platform.

### Section #2a - Prerequisites
The below listed tools are required to be installed.
1. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) 
2. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
3. Docker ([Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) | [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/))
4. [Google Cloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
5. The script can be run on [Google Cloud Shell](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell), Linux or Windows (with [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)).

Container based (Requires Docker to be installed on the host machine) deployment is also provided with above-listed tools pre-installed. 

### Section #2b - Clone the Repository
Clone the [horizon-sdv](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/horizon-sdv) OSS repository. If you do not need to customize the platform, you can clone and deploy directly from the upstream repository.

If you wish to customize the platform or host the repository on your own git provider (GitHub, Gerrit, etc.), fork or mirror the repository to a location accessible from wherever you are running Terraform. If you are using GitHub, refer to [Section #5d - Fork the Repository](#section-5d---fork-the-repository) for instructions on creating a fork.

```shell
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
```

### Section #2c - Configure Terraform Variables
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The credentials below are for demonstration purposes and may be different for your environment.
> Create a strong password with at least 12 characters in length and containing a combination of,
> - Uppercase letters [A -Z]
> - Lowercase letters [a -z]
> - Numbers [0 - 9]
> - Symbols [!@#$%^&* etc.]
>
> Failing to do so might break the cluster and lead to unstable and insecure cluster behavior.

1. Navigate to `terraform/env` and create a copy of `terraform.tfvars.sample` in the same directory with name `terraform.tfvars`.
2. Edit `terraform.tfvars` and replace `<REQUIRED>` placeholders with actual values.

      - `none`: Public repository (no authentication required)
    - `scm_repo_url`: Full repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo` or `https://gerrit.example.com/a/project`)
    - `scm_repo_branch`: Branch name to deploy from
    - If using `userpass` authentication:
      - `scm_username`: Username (use `git` for GitHub PAT, actual username for Gerrit/GitLab)
      - `scm_password`: Password or token (GitHub PAT, Gerrit HTTP password, GitLab token, etc.)
    - If using `app` authentication (GitHub only):
      - `sdv_github_app_id`: GitHub App ID from [Section #1c - Create and Install GitHub Application](#section-1c---create-and-install-github-application).
      - `sdv_github_app_install_id`:

      - No credentials needed - simply provide the repository URL and branch
  - Required Admin Secrets
    - `sdv_keycloak_admin_password`: Plain text value following the required password rules mentioned above.
    - `sdv_keycloak_horizon_admin_password`: Plain text value following the required password rules mentioned above.
  - Optional
    - `enable_arm64_dedicated_subnet`: Create dedicated ARM64 subnet/NAT (`true`) or use primary `sdv-subnet` for ARM64 Cuttlefish (`false`; ARM jobs still enabled but using primary subnet).
    - `sdv_enable_network_policies`: Enable or disable network policies for all workloads. Set to `false` to disable all NetworkPolicy resources (useful for debugging connectivity issues). Default: `true`.
    - `sdv_dns_dnssec_enabled`: Enable DNSSEC for the Cloud DNS zone. Requires domain ownership verification at [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console). Set to `false` to disable DNSSEC. Default: `true`.
    - `sdv_enable_kms_encryption`: Enable KMS encryption for Kubernetes secrets at rest using customer-managed encryption keys. Set to `false` (default) to skip KMS encryption and allow clean Terraform destroy. Set to `true` to enable application-layer secrets encryption. **Warning:** Once enabled and applied, KMS keyrings cannot be deleted from GCP; the only way to remove them is to delete the entire project.
    - `manual_secrets` : Optional map of secret values that can be set manually.
    - `sdv_gateway_internal`: Expose the platform through a **regional internal** Application Load Balancer (`gke-l7-rilb`) instead of the default global external one. Set this to `true` only if your organization forbids external load balancers (`constraints/compute.restrictLoadBalancerCreationForTypes`). Requires `sdv_dns_use_static_a_records = true`. Terraform then additionally creates a `REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY` subnet, a reserved internal VIP and a private Cloud DNS zone that resolves the platform domain to that VIP, and skips the Google-managed certificate. Default: `false`. See [Internal-only deployments](#internal-only-deployments).
    - `sdv_gateway_dev_access`: Deploy the optional in-cluster relay used by `tools/scripts/deployment/dev-access.sh` to reach an internal deployment from a workstation. Ignored unless `sdv_gateway_internal` is `true`. Default: `false`.
    - **Sub-Environments:** To deploy one or more sub-environments on the same cluster, define the `sdv_sub_env_configs` variable in `terraform.tfvars`. See the [Sub-Environment Deployment Guide](guides/sub_environments/sub_environment_deployment_guide.md#configuring-sub-environments) for the variable structure, required passwords, and naming rules.

#### Internal-only deployments

Some GCP organizations block external load balancers. In that case the platform cannot be published on a public hostname, and `sdv_gateway_internal = true` switches the deployment to a VPC-internal one. The trade-offs are:

| | External (default) | Internal |
|---|---|---|
| Ingress | global external ALB | regional internal ALB (`gke-l7-rilb`) |
| TLS | Google-managed certificate | none — the platform is served over **HTTP** inside the VPC |
| DNS | public Cloud DNS, nameserver delegation ([Section #3b](#section-3b---update-nameservers)) | private Cloud DNS zone created by Terraform |
| Browser access | any network | VPC only, or `tools/scripts/deployment/dev-access.sh` from a workstation |
| Google identity brokering ([Section #1d](#section-1d---create-oauth2-client-and-secret)) | supported | **not supported** (Google requires an `https` redirect URI) — use local Keycloak users |
| Inbound SCM webhooks | supported | **not supported** — Argo CD still polls the repository |

To reach the platform from a workstation, set `sdv_gateway_dev_access = true` and run:

```bash
./tools/scripts/deployment/dev-access.sh          # Ctrl+C to stop
./tools/scripts/deployment/dev-access.sh --undo   # remove the /etc/hosts entries
```

Because the platform URLs registered in Keycloak carry no port, the script listens on port 80 by default and asks for `sudo` to bind it and to edit `/etc/hosts`.

### Section #2d - Run the Deployment Script
Steps to start the Terraform workflow.

**Containerized deployment:**
1. Navigate to `tools/scripts/deployment`
2. Provisioning can be done by running `./container-deploy.sh [options]` or (Requires **Docker** to be installed on the machine).
>**Options :**
  - `-p, --plan` Preview infrastructure changes without applying them. Example: `./container-deploy.sh -p` or `./container-deploy.sh --plan`
  - `-a, --apply` Provision or update the infrastructure using Terraform. Example: `./container-deploy.sh -a` or `./container-deploy.sh --apply`
  - `-d, --destroy` Deprovision all Terraform-managed infrastructure resources. Example: `./container-deploy.sh -d` or `./container-deploy.sh --destroy`
  - `-h, --help` Display the help message with available commands. Example: `./container-deploy.sh -h` or `./container-deploy.sh --help`

3. The script `./container-deploy.sh` supports [**Google Cloud Shell**](https://docs.cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell), Linux or Windows (with [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)).

> [!Note]
> GCE Disks or other GCE resources provisioned by the GKE cluster will not be automatically removed while running
> deployment script with `--destroy` or `-d` flag as they are not managed by Terraform. A manual cleanup is required.

**Linux Native deployment:**
> [!Important]
> Use this deployment method ONLY on **Linux** (Ubuntu or Debian based distros), not tested on WSL or other platforms.

1. The below listed tools are required to be installed.
   1. [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
   2. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
   3. Docker - [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   4. [Google Cloud CLI](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)
2. Navigate to `tools/scripts/deployment`
3. Provisioning can be done by running `./deploy.sh [options]` (Requires all above-mentioned tools to be installed on the machine).
>**Options :**
  - `-p, --plan` Preview infrastructure changes without applying them. Example: `./deploy.sh -p` or `./deploy.sh --plan`
  - `-a, --apply` Provision or update the infrastructure using Terraform. Example: `./deploy.sh -a` or `./deploy.sh --apply`

> **Optional:** Skip this section if you already own `<HORIZON_DOMAIN>` and manage DNS through your own domain registrar or DNS provider. You still must set `sdv_root_domain` to your domain in [Section #2c - Configure Terraform Variables](#section-2c---configure-terraform-variables), then complete [Section #3b - Update Nameservers](#section-3b---update-nameservers) so `<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>` resolves correctly.

If you do not have a domain registered already, you can register one via GCP Cloud Domains.

1. Go to: Network Services → Cloud Domains → Register Domain
2. Choose a domain name `<HORIZON_DOMAIN>`
3. Select Cloud DNS and enable DNSSEC
4. Click Create

### Section #3b - Update Nameservers
To make your Cloud DNS zone active and reachable on the internet, you must update the Nameservers at your Domain Registrar. You must "point" your domain from the registrar to Google Cloud.

1. Navigate to Network Services, Cloud DNS.
2. Click on the Zone Name you created for`<HORIZON_DOMAIN>` .
3. Look at the list of records. You will see a record with Type NS.
4. Expand that record (if necessary) and copy all 4 values. They will look like:
  - `ns-cloud-a1.googledomains.com.`
  - `ns-cloud-b1.googledomains.com.`
  - `ns-cloud-c1.googledomains.com.`
  - `ns-cloud-d1.googledomains.com.`
5. Update your Domain Registrar with custom nameservers.

The process may differ based on your Domain Registrar.

#### Update Nameservers for GCP Registered Domains

Use this subsection when you completed [Section #3a (Optional) - Domain Setup via GCP](#section-3a-optional---domain-setup-via-gcp) and Terraform created a separate Cloud DNS zone for `<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>`. Terraform names that zone `<SUB_DOMAIN>-horizon-sdv-com` (DNS name: `<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>`).

Grab Terraform's name servers:

1. Go to Network Services → Cloud DNS in your console.
2. Click on the Terraform-managed zone: `<SUB_DOMAIN>-horizon-sdv-com`.
3. Look for the record with type `NS`.
4. Under the **Data** column, copy all 4 lines (they look like `ns-cloud-xx.googledomains.com.`).

Link them in your root zone:

1. Go back to your Cloud DNS zones list and click the root zone for `<HORIZON_DOMAIN>` (GCP typically names this zone with dots replaced by hyphens, for example `your-domain-com` for `your-domain.com`).
2. Click **+ Add Standard** (or **Add Record Set**) at the top.
3. **DNS Name:** type `<SUB_DOMAIN>` (so the full name below reads `<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>`).
4. **Resource Record Type:** select `NS`.
5. **Data:** paste the 4 name server lines you copied earlier.
6. Click **Create**.

#### DNSSEC implementation details (if enabled)

If you set `sdv_dns_dnssec_enabled = true` in `terraform.tfvars`, Terraform creates a Cloud DNS zone with DNSSEC. The following applies only when DNSSEC is enabled; you can set `sdv_dns_dnssec_enabled = false` to skip these steps.

##### Zone creation and authorization

When DNSSEC is enabled, Terraform creates a zone during deployment. You must verify that the account is authorized to create that zone. This can be done in [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).

1. In the Domain box on the left, type `<HORIZON_DOMAIN>` and click **Continue**.
2. If it says "Ownership auto-verified": you are done. You can close the tab.
3. If it gives you a TXT record to copy:
   1. Copy the TXT record.
   2. Go back to your root Cloud DNS zone for `<HORIZON_DOMAIN>`.
   3. Click **+ Add Standard**. Leave the DNS name blank (so it applies to the root domain), select **TXT** as the type, paste the code, and save it.
   4. Go back to Search Console and click **Verify**.

##### DS record (optional)

After the zone is created by Terraform, you can retrieve a **DS** record and add it to the root zone for `<HORIZON_DOMAIN>` to make the subdomain fully DNSSEC compliant. The setup works even without this step.

1. Get the key from Terraform:
   1. Go to Network Services → Cloud DNS.
   2. Click on the Terraform-managed zone: `<SUB_DOMAIN>-horizon-sdv-com`.
   3. In the top-right corner, click **Registrar Setup**.
   4. Under **DS Records**, copy the data.
2. Paste the key into your root zone:
   1. Go back to your Cloud DNS zones list and click the root zone for `<HORIZON_DOMAIN>`.
   2. Click **+ Add Standard** (Add record).
   3. **DNS Name:** type `<SUB_DOMAIN>`.
   4. **Resource Record Type:** select `DS`.
   5. **Data:** paste the DS record data you copied.
   6. Click **Create**.

- **Verification:** DNSSEC can be verified on the [DNSSEC Debugger](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/) site.

- **Disabling DNSSEC:** DNSSEC can be disabled in `terraform.tfvars`; in that case the steps above are not needed.

### Section #3j - Enable Workloads Modules in Developer Portal

> [!NOTE]
> Admin access via Keycloak `administrators` group is required. See [Section #3e - Jenkins Access via Keycloak Groups](#section-3e---jenkins-access-via-keycloak-groups) for group assignment steps.

Where Android workloads are required, enable modules in the **Horizon Developer Portal** so that Jenkins seed jobs and workflow templates work properly:

1. Open **Administration → Modules** at
   `https://<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>/developer-portal/admin/modules`
2. Under **Administration**, enable **`workloads-common`**, then **`workloads-android`**, in that order.

Skip or adjust modules if your environment intentionally does not use Android workloads.

After modules are enabled, run the Jenkins seed job and regenerate workload templates as described in [`workloads/seed.md`](workloads/seed.md).

## Section #6 - Troubleshooting

### Section #6a - Keycloak sign-in failure
Check the below sections for issues related to sign-in after the cluster has been provisioned and Keycloak is setup with google identity provider.

#### Redirect URI mismatch
- Log-in to Keycloak and select "Horizon" realm.
- Go to Identity providers and click on "google" provider.
- Copy the redirect URI available in the google identity provider.
- Now, go to "APIs & Services" click and open "Credentials".
- Click on "Horizon" under OAuth 2.0 Client IDs.
- Make sure the URI mentioned under "Authorized redirect URIs" is the same as the one in Keycloak google provider.
- If the URIs do not match, replace the URI mentioned under "Authorized redirect URIs".

#### User does not exist with google identity provider
If you are getting the error "User <USER_NAME> authenticated with Identity provider google does not exist. Please contact your administrator".   
- Log-in to Keycloak and select "Horizon" realm.
- Go to Users, click on your user.
- Make sure both Username and Email fields have the complete Email address.

### Section #6b - Error when reading or editing Certificate
```shell
│  Error: Error when reading or editing Certificate: googleapi: Error 400: can't delete certificate that is referenced by a CertificateMapEntry or other resources
│ Details:
│ [
│   {
│     "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.PreconditionFailure",
│     "violations": [
│       {
│         "description": "can't delete certificate that is referenced by a CertificateMapEntry or other resources",
│         "subject": "projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/global/certificates/horizon-sdv",
│         "type": "RESOURCE_STILL_IN_USE"
│       }
│     ]
│   }
│ ]
```
If facing above error, as a workaround, run the below command to temporarily enable edit or removal of the certificate.

```shell
gcloud certificate-manager maps delete horizon-sdv-map
```

### Section #6c - Docker permission denied
If you encounter below error on Linux,
```
Building deployer image...
ERROR: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Head "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/_ping": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

Follow post-install steps as shown in [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

### Section #6d - Docker Container build resource issues
```shell
│ Error: Error running legacy build: process "/bin/sh -c apt-get update && apt-get install -y     curl     git     build-essential     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*" did not complete successfully: exit code: 100
│
│
│
│   with module.base.module.sdv_container_images.docker_image.sdv-container-images["gerrit-mcp-server-app"],
│   on ../modules/sdv-container-images/main.tf line 20, in resource "docker_image" "sdv-container-images":
│   20: resource "docker_image" "sdv-container-images" {
│
```
 Building Docker containers can be resource-intensive. If you encounter build failures (such as `exit code: 100` as shown above or unexpected timeouts), please increase the CPU and Memory allocated to Docker and re-run the deployment script.

### Section #6e - Error creating SslPolicy
```shell
│ Error: Error creating SslPolicy: googleapi: Error 409: The resource 'projects/<PROJECT_ID>/global/sslPolicies/gke-ssl-policy' already exists, alreadyExists
│
│   with module.base.module.sdv_ssl_policy.google_compute_ssl_policy.gke_ssl_policy,
│   on ../modules/sdv-ssl-policy/main.tf line 21, in resource "google_compute_ssl_policy" "gke_ssl_policy":
│   21: resource "google_compute_ssl_policy" "gke_ssl_policy" {
│
```
A manual workaround for this error, run the below command,

```shell
gcloud compute ssl-policies delete gke-ssl-policy --global --project=sdva-2108202401
```

### Section #6f - Homepage not reachable after deployment

If you cannot access `https://<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>` but you can access `https://<SUB_DOMAIN>.<HORIZON_DOMAIN>/argocd`, you most likely have a cluster sync issue.

Log in with the Argo CD admin credentials:

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** Retrieve from GCP Secret Manager under the secret named `argocd-admin-password-b64`. It can also be set via `manual_secrets` key `s5` in `terraform.tfvars` (see the `manual_secrets` block in `terraform/env/terraform.tfvars.sample`).
  - If the password does not work, set a new value in `terraform.tfvars`: `manual_secrets = { s5 = "<your-password>" ... }` and redeploy.
- After logging in to Argo CD, check the health state of the `horizon-sdv` application.
- If it is unhealthy, click **Refresh** and then **Sync**.
- Wait for the cluster to update and recover to **Healthy** state.

### Section #6g - Jenkins cannot run pipeline as admin

If you cannot run pipelines as admin and see an error about insufficient permissions, try the steps below.

>[!NOTE]
>Preferred approach: assign Keycloak groups as described in [Section #3e - Jenkins Access via Keycloak Groups](#section-3e---jenkins-access-via-keycloak-groups), then log out and log back in to Jenkins. Use the steps below only if group assignment did not resolve the issue.

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage and Assign Roles** → **Assign Roles**.
2. Under **Global Roles**:
   1. In the **User/group to add** box, type the exact email you are logged in with (see your user profile in Jenkins), for example `yourname@yourmail.com`.
   2. Click **Add**.
   3. In the new row, check the box for `administrators`.
3. Under **Item Roles**:
   1. In the **User/group to add** box, type your exact email again.
   2. Click **Add**.
   3. Check the box for `developers`.
4. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.
